# GitHub Pages Deployment

## ✅ Deployment Status

Your React portfolio has been successfully deployed to the `gh-pages` branch!

## 🔧 GitHub Pages Configuration

To make your portfolio live at **https://garry-p12.github.io/Portfolio/**, you need to configure GitHub Pages:

### Steps:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/garry-p12/Portfolio
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `gh-pages`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

Your site should be live within a few minutes at: **https://garry-p12.github.io/Portfolio/**

## 📝 Important Notes

- The built site is in the `gh-pages` branch
- Source code should be in the `main` branch (if you want to keep it)
- The site uses base path `/Portfolio/` to match your GitHub Pages URL
- All images and assets are properly configured

## 🚀 Re-deploying After Changes

To update the deployed site after making changes:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
1. Build the production-ready version
2. Deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages will automatically update within a few minutes

## 📁 Repository Structure
